# Shopify Summer 2019 Developer Intern Challenge
My name is Justin Abrokwah and I'm applying to be a Backend Developer Intern at Shopify!

This project is my take on the challenge you provided. I used Java as my programming language, and Apache CXF and Spring Boot to get the server running. This is a RESTful server that works through URL's. For best use, one can use an HTTP too like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/ "Postman").

To start the server, you can open the project in your IDE and run the main method in [ChallengeApplication.java](https://github.com/JAbrokwah/shopify-s19-challenge/blob/master/src/main/java/challenge/ChallengeApplication.java). Another way to start it up, (if Maven is installed) is to open the terminal in the top level project folder, and enter: `mvn spring-boot:run`.

Once starting the server using either method, you should see some output on whichever console is opened for you. The last line should read:
`Started ChallengeApplication in _ seconds (JVM running for _)` where the underscores signify the number of seconds for each time.

This signifies that the server started successfully, then you are ready to try it out! If not, then you may have to do some troubleshooting first.
